# Mobile Optimization Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive mobile optimizations implemented for the Studio Narmak website to ensure excellent user experience across all mobile devices.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Navigation Menu Visibility
**Problem**: The main navigation menu was hidden on mobile devices (only visible on `md:` breakpoint and above).

**Solution**: 
- Added a responsive hamburger menu button for mobile devices
- Implemented a slide-out sidebar navigation with smooth animations
- Created a mobile-friendly menu structure with proper touch targets
- Added overlay and close functionality for better UX

### 2. Trusted Companies Logo Layout
**Problem**: Client logos were displayed in fixed grid layouts (`grid-cols-5` and `grid-cols-4`) causing cramped display on mobile.

**Solution**:
- Implemented responsive grid system: `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5`
- Added responsive image sizing with proper max-width constraints
- Improved spacing with responsive gaps: `gap-4 sm:gap-6 md:gap-8`
