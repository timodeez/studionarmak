## Video Optimization Guide

Created comprehensive guides for optimizing video file sizes:

1. **PowerShell Script** (`/public/optimize-hero-reel.ps1`)
   - Automated video compression script
   - Creates optimized versions for mobile and desktop
   - Supports both MP4 and WebM formats

2. **Optimization Guide** (`HERO-REEL-OPTIMIZATION.md`)
   - Detailed recommendations for reducing file sizes
   - Current desktop MP4 is 29MB (should be < 15MB)
   - Includes FFmpeg commands and best practices

## Performance Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Run the optimization script to reduce video file sizes
2. Consider trimming hero reel to under 30 seconds
3. Implement lazy loading for better performance

### File Size Targets:
- **Mobile videos**: < 5MB
- **Desktop videos**: < 15MB
- **Current sizes are too large** (desktop: 29MB)

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# To optimize videos:
cd public
./optimize-hero-reel.ps1

# To test locally:
npm run dev
```

## Testing Notes

- Build completed successfully
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Videos should now work properly
- Test in incognito mode if you don't see changes (clears cache)

## Browser Caching Issue

If sections appear missing in regular browser mode but work in incognito:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for any errors

The website should now have all sections restored with working videos!
